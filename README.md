# CyberCriminal-Profiling
Cybercriminal activities are increasing rapidly, making cybersecurity an essential field of research and development. This project, "Cyber Criminal Profiling System," aims to analyze network activity logs, detect suspicious behavior, and generate attacker profiles based on predefined attack patterns. 

# Overview

The Cyber Criminal Profiling System is designed to analyze network logs, detect cyber threats, and generate attacker profiles. It identifies brute force attacks and port scanning attempts, helping security professionals in threat monitoring and mitigation. This project is implemented in C and Java for flexibility and ease of deployment.

# Features
Reads and processes network logs from a file
Detects brute force attacks (multiple failed login attempts)
Identifies port scanning activities
Generates attacker profiles based on their IP addresses
Supports C and Java implementations

# Installation & Usage
Compile the C program:

  gcc profiling.c -o profiling

Run the executable:

  ./profiling


Ensure the log file (network_logs.txt) is in the same directory.
